# eightfoldai-Part2-CorPora
This is the code base of Team CorPora for the INNOV8 2.0 challenge for Part 2

This code base consists of two parts broadly:
# Definition of Directory and Dataset Path
- Define the directory and the path to save the generated synthetic dataset
# Data Generation
- Generation of a synthetic dataset of Xernians on which we will test our Solution
- Run this code section to generate synthetic code
- 'max_limit' dictionary is defined for a user to tweak the maximum limit of each numerical column
# Solution Pipeline
- Prediction of Army rank-wise traitor prediction based on weights extracted using Analytical Hierarchy Process
